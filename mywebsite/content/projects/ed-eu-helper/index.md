## Overview

Outcome based education(OBE) is a common methodology adopted by institutes of higher learning. This aids in bringing out the best from the programs that these institutes provide to students. As a part of this process, various analyses is done to understand the level to which the Teaching-Learning process has been effective, and for accreditors to inspect and accredit the program. This has been commonly implemented in a data oriented manner. The proposed work intends to amalgamate this approach along with a faculty oriented approach, such that it not only brings out the analyses, but it also simplifies the overall process. A part of the proposed work involves a stack based approach to extract properties of questions, such as Course Outcomes(COs), Bloom's Taxonomy levels(BTLs), Difficulty levels(DLs), Total marks, and store it in the Database. The other part includes the attainment calculations for each course, and the analyses for each course based on various attributes. A stack which comprises Python and its libraries like Numpy, Pandas, Flask, has been used to implement and experiment on the same.
