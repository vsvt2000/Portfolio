## Overview

Cricket is a sport that is widely hailed in India. It is followed fervently in the country, such that some players are worshiped, and are considered holy. Created by shepherds of England, it has now grown significantly, and equipped some of the most advanced technologies to its armory, which help players improve their performances, and also plan strategies against opposition teams. The proposed work aims at analyzing the performance of the Indian Cricket Team in Test format. All oppositions are considered, and the data is analyzed to extract valuable information, which could help serve as an indicator for future performances. Exploratory Data analysis and Visualization was done using python libraries such as pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn. Classification models were implemented for the data based on number of overs, and their results were analyzed. Random Forest Classifier was the most effective among the models implemented, with an accuracy of 75%.
