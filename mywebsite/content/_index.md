I am an SDE-1 currently working at **Wiz**(a part of Radar Ventures),Chennai.

I am a **full-stack developer**, and I am also a **data science enthusiast**. I have been exploring a wide range of tools, and I encountered Congo. Congo is flexible and is great for both static page-based content (like this page) or a traditional blog with a feed of recent posts.Explore the [sample pages]({{< ref "projects" >}}) to get a feel for what Congo can do. If you like what you see, check out the project on [Github](https://github.com/jpanther/congo)
